# Project Overview

This is a Python-based fitness tracking application. It allows users to track workouts, including exercises, sets, reps, and weight. It also includes a feature to calculate the one-rep max (1RM) for a given lift.

The application is structured in an object-oriented manner with the following key files:
- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application.
- `exercise.py`: Defines the `Exercise` class to represent a single exercise.
- `workout.py`: Defines the `Workout` class to represent a workout session, which can contain multiple exercises.
- `calculations.py`: Includes calculations such as the one-rep max (1RM).
- `cardio.py`, `data_manager.py`, `userstats.py`: Placeholder files for future features.

# Building and Running

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

# Development Conventions

- The project follows an object-oriented approach.
- The `main.py` file is the primary entry point.
- The project is in its early stages of development. Placeholder files suggest planned features around cardio tracking, data management, and user statistics.
